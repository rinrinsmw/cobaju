# Cobaju backend

This FastAPI service contains Cobaju's backend through Phase 3:

- settings loaded from environment variables or the repository root `.env`;
- a SQLModel engine and per-request session dependency;
- a local SQLite database;
- Alembic migration configuration and an initial revision;
- API and database health checks;
- a user table managed by Alembic;
- Argon2 password hashing and short-lived JWT access tokens;
- registration, login, and protected current-user routes;
- a clothing item table with category and processing-status enums;
- authenticated wardrobe create, list, detail, partial update, and delete routes;
- ownership checks that hide other users' items;
- a maximum of 15 completed items per user;
- pytest coverage for settings, sessions, health, authentication, CRUD,
  authorization, validation, and wardrobe limits.

Image upload and AI functionality intentionally begin in later phases.

## Wardrobe endpoints

All routes use the authenticated user from the JWT and never accept a client
`user_id`:

```text
POST   /wardrobe/items
GET    /wardrobe/items
GET    /wardrobe/items/{item_id}
PATCH  /wardrobe/items/{item_id}
DELETE /wardrobe/items/{item_id}
```

Create and update bodies use `name`, `category`, `color`, and optional
`description`. Categories are `top`, `bottom`, `dress`, `outerwear`, `shoes`,
`bag`, and `accessory`. A manual create is immediately `completed`; processing
status is returned by the API but cannot be set by the client.

## Run from the repository root

Install dependencies and apply migrations:

```bash
uv sync --project apps/backend
moon run backend:migrate
```

Start the API:

```bash
moon run backend:dev
```

Run the backend tests:

```bash
moon run backend:test
```

The API requires `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in the repository root `.env` before login
tokens can be issued. Copy `.env.example` and replace its placeholder with a
private random value such as the output of `openssl rand -hex 32`.

Native uv commands are also available:

```bash
uv run --project apps/backend alembic -c apps/backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
uv run --project apps/backend pytest apps/backend/tests
uv run --project apps/backend uvicorn --app-dir apps/backend app.main:app --reload
```
